#  A* Is a pathfinding algorithm that is popularly used in video game development
#   It works in a similar way to Dijkstras algorithm, where each tile is a graph node
#    However, A* estimates the remaining distance to the end node, which allows this algorithm
#     to reach the destination on average much quicker than Dijkstras', "A* Pathfinding
